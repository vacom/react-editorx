# React usage and implementation for EditorJS

[Editor.js](https://github.com/codex-team/editor.js) is a Block-Styled editor. Blocks are structural units, of which the Entry is composed. For example, Paragraph, Heading, Image, Video, List are Blocks. Each Block is represented by Plugin. We have many ready-to-use Plugins and a simple API for creating new ones.

### Update

I made this implementation 6 months ago, but I just updated the dependencies and made it public for everyone. In this implementation I converted EditorJS to support React and added a Read Only mode (EditorToHtml) something that doesn't come in the library.
